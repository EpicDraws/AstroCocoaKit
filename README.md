AstroCocoaKit
=============

AstroCocoaKit is a OSX (and soon-iOS) Framework written in Objective-C to handle some basic and less basic
calculations of astronomical interest. It replaces the obsolete [AstroCocoaPackage](https://github.com/onekiloparsec/AstroCocoaPackage).

The kit is used to develop the new version of iObserve ([web](http://onekilopars.ec), app stores: [mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iobserve/id424693907?ls=1&mt=12), [ios](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iobserve/id756649970?ls=1&mt=8)).

In code comments, "AA" refers to Jean Meeus' Astronomical Algorithms textbook.

Even if not always correct in their headers, the Licence of this kit applies in every KPC files.
